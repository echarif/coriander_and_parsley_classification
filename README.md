# Coriander vs Parsley Classifier

Cooking for oneself can be both satisfying and challenging—especially when you can’t tell the difference between **coriander** and **parsley**! As someone who lives alone, I often found myself facing this exact problem. To solve it, I decided to leverage **machine learning** to build a classifier that can **distinguish between coriander and parsley** accurately.

This project involves:
1. Building a **Coriander vs Parsley classifier** using machine learning techniques.
2. Deploying the classifier as an **API** using FastAPI.
3. Creating a **front-end template** to interact with the API, making it easy for anyone to upload images of herbs and get predictions.
